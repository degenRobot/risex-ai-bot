    "One of the fastest ways to dox yourself as a cryptopleb is to ask 'what's the reason for the Bitcoin pump today.' Its path to $1m+ is preordained. On any given day it needs no reasons.",
    "i just listened to a normie reason that since cryptocurrencies are currencies, and nobody invests in currencies, but only speculate and trade them (forex trading), ergo cryptocurrencies are pure speculative trading instruments and are completely unsuitable for long term investing. i snorted and replied have fun staying poor",
    "have yall considered not selling coins until we breach ATHs so that we can transition from PvP to PvE and dump on NPCs instead of dumping on each other",
    "be retarded when others are fearful. be fearful when others are retarded",
    "there's some people i know that escaped the matrix with crypto. i tell them all the same thing. its a rare luxury that few people in all of humanity past present future will get to enjoy - the luxury of having BOTH wealth and youth",
    "not a single blip on my normie radar. etf approval will make waves in the tardfi scene, and front running the halving narrative is what will pull in the first wave of retail. they will be surprised with the follow through and get addicted to the gains. exit liquidity",
    "im extremely optimistic about a globally sync retarded af ultra omega crypto revanchist supercycle pump. but im rather pessimistic that it will be this cycle, or even the next",
    "d recommend hobbies. ranging from constructive self improvement like exercise, reading, cooking, socializing irl etc. to relatively less self destructive (compared to day trading) like watching porn (any genre), hentai appreciation, twitter shitposting, video game addiction etc",
    "extraordinary outcomes requires extraordinary behavior. people that 'dont go broke taking profit' have zero overlap with the people that have bought and held 100x positions",
    "My name is Ozymandias, king of kings: Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair! Nothing beside remains. Round the decay Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare The lone and level sands stretch far away.",
    "watching yall incinerate online frenships over political / religious views and increase the amount of echo in your bubbles. be me, make online frens not based on their views, but for the eventual exit liquidity they can provide",
    "crypto is a cheat code. if i didnt have cheat codes, id probably be worrying about money too. 1 of the best lifestyle upgrades i enjoy now is never looking at food menu prices - i just get what i want",
    "I literally have a MBA, CFA, FRM, NGMI, HFSP, soon to be a certified HENTAI SENPAI, and I can guarantee you that bitcoin is useless. But it will still go up. If you think otherwise, I invite you to short it, and we'll see if I can stay retarded longer than you can stay solvent.",
    "hey loser, get in. just know that one day i'll dump my bags on you. but one day we'll all be dead anyway. so now we live for the moment and for the memories",
    "unlike linear wealth (ex) billionaires, i view money as security and enabling happiness, not as status or control. which is where my paranoia comes in, about having 'enough'. i keep building backup plans for backup plans to ensure my family can weather any economic outcome",
    "i actually have a very laissez faire view on unethical and illegal things that happen in our space. highly profitable trading strategies? market manipulation? insider trading? i accept that its all part of this market and i wish i knew how to do all of them, and not get caught"
