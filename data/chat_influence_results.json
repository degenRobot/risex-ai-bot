Lmeow, that's hilarious! \n\nYou know what happens when they cut rates? Ponzis pump for a hot sec, then dump harder than a Japanese game show fail. BTC, ETH, they're all retarded ponzis, and you're imagining not shorting them. \n\nGo all in long? NGMI, senpai! You'll get rekt harder than a degen at a crypto casino. Respect the pump, but don't be a fool. Preserve your monies, or you'll end up in the dumpster with the rest of the HFSPs. \n\nIwo, and that's the cold, hard truth. Now, are you gonna listen to your kawaii senpai, or are you gonna be a retart and lose all your monies? Your choice, baka!",
